# Handover to Claude Code — state of the project on 02/10/2026 (slice A1–A3 done; A4–A5 sessions 1 and 2 of 3 done)

Read this at the start of a session when you need context beyond `CLAUDE.md`. Keep it current: when a slice lands, move it from "Next" to "Done" and update "Known gaps".

## Where the work lives
- The only copy that matters is this folder on Kamrul's PC (`C:\Users\User\Desktop\Cowork\Setu Health APP\setu`), a git repo on `main`. Push to the private GitHub repo `setu` after every session.
- Design and spec inputs (never edit): `docs/design-handoff/` (domain model, roles × screens × plans, i18n, tokens, print specs), `docs/prototype/` (Claude Design pages), `docs/test-log/` (walkthrough test log — the acceptance list).
- Plan: `docs/BUILD-PLAN.md`. Day-to-day runbook and slice prompts: `docs/CLAUDE-CODE-GUIDE.md`.

## Done (phase 0 complete)
- Monorepo: pnpm + Turborepo; `pnpm dev / typecheck / test / e2e / db:*`.
- `packages/domain`: Bangla/English formatting (`format`), money in paisa, access matrix generated from the prototype nav (`access-matrix.json`, 11 modules, 65 screens, 9 roles, 3 plans) with `authorize`, `capabilities`, `defaultScreen`; 17 state machines (`machines.ts`). 22 tests.
- `packages/db`: Prisma schema (tenancy, identity, Patient/RelatedPerson, Session/Device, AuditEvent, IdempotencyKey, Sequence); migration `init` applied locally with `rls.sql` (RLS forced on 12 tables, append-only audit trigger); seed = Green Life Clinic, 10 users (password `setu1234`, PIN `1234`), 4 walkthrough patients, ward 2A. `prisma.config.ts`; scripts load the root `.env` through dotenv-cli.
- `packages/contracts`: Zod schemas (bilingual `ApiError`, Login, Me, PIN, Capabilities, Health) + OpenAPI generator.
- `packages/i18n`: 2,082 design strings in 20 namespaces, fallback loader, test that every bn key has en.
- `packages/ui`: `styles/setu.css` (classes mirroring the DS pages, all tokens), self-hosted fonts, components (Icon, Button, Segmented, Pill, Card, Field, Dialog, Toast, Table, PatientHeaderBanner, PageState, OfflineBanner).
- `apps/api` (Fastify): `/health`, login (signed cookie), `/v1/me`, `/v1/me/capabilities`, PIN verify (5 tries / 15-min lock); plugins: session, audit (every PHI route writes `AuditEvent`), idempotency (replay returns stored response). Loads root `.env`; without `DATABASE_URL` it serves in-memory demo users and accepts `demoPlan` at login. 7 contract tests.
- `apps/staff` (Next.js 15): login page, session context (lang, numerals, online, patient banner slot), Shell (top bar: org, F2 search, Ctrl+K palette, sync pill, বাং/EN and ০১২৩/0123 toggles, user; nav from capabilities with plan locks; offline banner), home per role (prototype content, marked as sample), `/m/[mod]/[screen]` with Permission-denied / Not-in-plan / slice placeholder; `modules/registry.tsx` maps screens to components. `/api/*` is proxied to the API by `next.config.ts`.
- `e2e/journeys/shell.spec.ts`: 13 Playwright specs (9 roles, denied, Clinic/Lite locks, toggles, palette, 390 px).
- Verified locally on 02/10/2026: `/api/health` → db up; doctor login shows the home with 4 modules in Bangla.

## Done (slice A1–A3, 02/10/2026) — front desk ✅
Status: **done**. Search, duplicate review, registration and queue work end to end on the real stack as `setu_app`; all checks green (see Tests).
- **Database role — known gap 1 (RLS bypassed) is closed:** the API connects as `setu_app` (no superuser, no BYPASSRLS) via `DATABASE_URL_APP`; migrations and the seed keep the owner `DATABASE_URL`. `pnpm db:migrate` sets the role's password from `DATABASE_URL_APP`. Login's only pre-tenant read is the `auth_login_lookup` SECURITY DEFINER function. `apps/api/test/tenancy.test.ts` proves a wrong `app.tenant_id` returns no rows.
- **One transaction per request:** `apps/api/src/command.ts` — `command()` (write + audit + idempotency key together; key required) and `query()` (read + view audit).
- **Rules** in `@setu/domain`: `patient.ts` (registration validation, normalisation, Same/Similar/Different/Missing comparison, link rules) and `queue.ts` (A-017 tokens, Dhaka day, board = view of ENCOUNTER). No new state machines: visits use ENCOUNTER, duplicate review is a `Task` through APPROVAL, identity confidence changes with a `Provenance` row.
- **Models:** `Encounter` (token attributes, per-branch daily `Sequence`), `Task`, `Provenance` (append-only), `Tenant.patientNoPrefix`, Patient approx-age fields. Seed: Mirpur branch, the walkthrough family on 01711-234567, plan-demo tenants (Clinic nurse 01722000004, Lite doctor 01733000002).
- **API:** search, matches, match-preview, match decisions + undo, register, create visit, queue, queue actions, duplicate-review queue, admin unlink, admin keep (`packages/contracts/src/frontdesk.ts`, `openapi.json`).
- **Screens:** `fd/search`, `fd/match`, `fd/register`, `fd/queue` in `apps/staff/modules/fd/`; strings in `packages/i18n/locales/app/frontDeskApp.json`; offline outbox `apps/staff/lib/outbox.ts` (pending writes show "not synced", the shell's sync count reads it).
- **Tests:** domain 49, api 44 (incl. 26 front desk + cross-tenant, 6 transaction/idempotency), i18n 3, contracts 2; Playwright 24 (13 shell + 11 `a1-a3.spec.ts`), green twice in a row on 02/10/2026.
- **Reviews:** security and clinical-safety reviews ran on the slice; fixes landed, the rest is in `docs/open-questions.md` 17–24.
- **Decision 16 (Kamrul, 02/10/2026): "Link anyway" stays immediate**, with admin after-the-fact review:
  - `fd/match` with no patient is the **duplicate-review queue**: open "Send for review" items and links made with "Link anyway", shown as **"Linked with override"** until an admin reviews them.
  - Admin **Unlink** (on the queue and on a linked patient's record): reason ≥10 characters, record becomes `unverified`, Provenance `unlink`, audited; the desk's Undo cannot reach back past it. Admin **Keep link — reviewed** takes it off the queue (Provenance `link-reviewed`). The Task stays `approved` (APPROVAL has no way back); the outcome is stored in `Task.detail.review`.
  - Visits opened on the linked record between link and unlink stay where they are (open question 17).
- **Hands-on walkthrough (02/10/2026)** as receptionist 01711000001 through search → duplicate review → register → queue in the browser; 10 issues found and fixed (see commit "A1-A3: fixes from the hands-on walkthrough").
- Decisions and rules chosen in this slice: `docs/open-questions.md` — please read and confirm.

## Done (slice A4–A5, session 1 of 3, 02/10/2026) — follow-ups + vitals (A4) ✅
Plan agreed with Kamrul: two sessions (decision D5). Decisions D1–D4 and items 25–44: `docs/open-questions.md` (A4–A5).
- **A1–A3 follow-ups (open questions 17, 18, 19, 22, 23):**
  - Undo of a desk decision: only its maker or an admin; undoing a "Link anyway" needs a reason (≥10); a dialog lists
    the visits opened on the linked record since (they stay there). `GET /v1/patients/:id/matches` returns `lastDecision`.
  - ADR 0002: Provenance source `desk-decision` for link / link-anyway / review / different / undo / unlink / reviewed.
  - Match preview on the register screen returns name, patient no., age and sex only.
  - Refused offline writes show in the top bar as "N couldn't sync — check" with the server's reason (`RefusedSync`).
  - No own phone: phone owner Guardian / Family / Other needs that person's name and relationship; stored on the
    RelatedPerson.
- **ADR 0003** (D1): DOCUMENT gains `draft --signAmendment--> amended`; used in session 2.
- **Vitals (A4):** `@setu/domain` `vitals.ts` (impossible / critical / high / low, BMI Asian cut-offs) shared by screen
  and API; `Observation` model (append-only for `setu_app`, RLS); `GET /v1/vitals/worklist`, `GET|POST
  /v1/encounters/:id/vitals`; first batch moves the token Waiting → Vitals done; screen `fd/vitals` (worklist → entry),
  outbox when offline; queue has a "Record vitals" shortcut for nurse/receptionist. Seed: Rahima Khatun's 12/08/2026
  visit with vitals (Green Life + E2E), E2E nurse 01799000004.
- **ADR 0003 guard** in `@setu/domain` `signDocument` (`documents.ts`): only a draft that amends another version, with
  a reason, signs to `amended`.
- **Reviews:** security (pass, 4 medium / 4 low) and clinical safety (glucose mg/dL slip, BP flags, offline ordering,
  unit hints, BMI, child labels, outbox expiry) — fixes landed; the rest is `docs/open-questions.md` 45–51.
- **Kamrul's decisions on 45–49 (same day):** default thresholds = prototype + adult NEWS2 (labelled pending clinician
  sign-off); "Critical vital sign" flag on the queue card; earlier readings from the owner's other branches shown
  read-only with the branch name; undoing a Link anyway turns its admin-queue entry into "Link undone + reason".
- **Hands-on test (02/10/2026)** in Green Life as receptionist 01711000001 → nurse 01711000004 at tablet 1024 px:
  pulse 300 blocked (screen + API 400), glucose 40 needs the re-checked tick, language switched to English mid-entry
  (values and tick kept), saved only after server confirm, the queue card showed "Critical vital sign"; the visit was
  then marked no-show (Green Life keeps one A-001 no-show and that vitals batch for 02/10/2026). Found and fixed:
  sign-out returned 500 (the client sent an empty JSON body; the API now answers Fastify client errors as 4xx);
  the top bar overflowed at 1024 px (toggles squeezed, page scrolled sideways); the glucose warning ran past its card.
  Regression specs added (shell: sign-out, tablet top bar in bn and en; a4: warning stays inside the card).
- **Tests:** domain 78, api 66, i18n 3, contracts 2; Playwright 32 (16 shell + 12 `a1-a3` + 4 `a4`) with plain
  `pnpm e2e`, green twice in a row on 02/10/2026.

## Done (slice A4–A5, session 2 of 3, 02/10/2026) — consultation backend (A5 plan steps 1–6) ✅
Plan agreed with Kamrul the same day, split after step 6 (decision 2): **session 3** does the screens, the journey spec,
the reviews and the hands-on test. Kamrul's decisions for this session: open questions "Session 2 — decided by Kamrul".
- **Rules in `@setu/domain`** (screen and API call the same functions):
  - `catalog.ts`: the prototype's sample lists — 10 ICD-11 codes flagged `unverified-prototype`; 15 medicines labelled
    sample with ingredient and class keys (no DGDA numbers, no prices); orderable tests incl. CBC, RBS, S. Electrolytes
    (for the A6 bill); the demo interaction (Clopidogrel + Omeprazole) and duplicate-class (PPI) rules.
  - `prescription.ts`: `rxWarnings` / `rxBlockers` — allergy (by class or ingredient; Remove only), same medicine (by
    generic ingredient, Seclo = omeprazole; Remove or Keep both), same class, interaction acknowledge, dose and days.
  - `consultation.ts`: `signBlockers` (Rx + complaint + diagnosis + AI "I reviewed" tick + free-text-allergy check +
    amendment reason), `consultAccess` (decision 28; only a doctor starts the visit; re-open is a no-op),
    `parseComplaint`.
  - **ADR 0004** + `ALLERGY` machine (`active → entered-in-error`).
- **Database** (migration `consultation`): sample catalogues per tenant (read-only for `setu_app`), AllergyIntolerance,
  Composition (one row per version), Condition, MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest; RLS on all. **Triggers for every
  role:** a signed note is never edited or deleted (only final/amended → superseded/entered-in-error); diagnoses and Rx
  lines change only in a draft; a placed order is never edited or deleted; an allergy is never deleted or edited (only
  active → entered-in-error with who, when and a reason ≥10). One draft and one current version per visit (partial
  unique indexes). Seed: catalogues in all 4 tenants; Rahima Khatun's Penicillin (rash) and Sulfa allergies and her
  signed 12/08/2026 note (5A11, BA00; Comet, Seclo, Amdocal) in Green Life and the E2E clinic; E2E doctor 2 (01799000003).
- **API** (`apps/api/src/modules/consultation.ts`, `routes/consultation.ts`, `packages/contracts/src/consultation.ts`):
  catalogue search (bn/en), worklist, consultation view (versions, allergies, current medicines and past diagnoses from
  earlier signed notes, critical-vitals flag), open, save draft, sign, amend, AI draft, record allergy, mark
  entered-in-error. **Sign** = PIN checked inside the transaction (shared 5 tries / 15 min, `modules/pin.ts`) →
  `signBlockers` re-run on the server's data (422 `sign_blocked`) → `signDocument` (DOCUMENT) → orders `order`
  (ORDER) → visit `finish` (ENCOUNTER) → Provenance for the note, every item and every reviewed AI section. Nothing is
  final until that commits; there is no client-side "signed". **Amend** = new version (v+1) copying v1; signing it
  supersedes v1 first, then signs v2 `amended`, in one transaction (ADR 0003). The PIN is never stored, not even in the
  idempotency hash (`command(…, { hashOmit: ["pin"] })`). FakeAi adapter (`apps/api/src/adapters/ai.ts`) builds drafts
  only from the patient's own record. A state-machine refusal now answers 409 `invalid_transition` (was 500).
- **Tests:** domain 111 (+33), api 83 (+17 in `consultation.test.ts`: care relationship, cross-tenant, screen-and-API
  same blocker, Napa + Ace, wrong PIN / lock, AI tick, free-text allergy, final only after the server, orders placed,
  queue Done, replay, PIN not stored, DB refuses edits to a signed note, amend v1 → superseded, allergy
  entered-in-error), contracts 2, i18n 3; `pnpm typecheck` 13/13. The API suite was green twice in a row.
  **Playwright was not re-run this session** (no screen changed; the local server check was not available to Claude) —
  run plain `pnpm e2e` at the start of session 3; 32 specs were green at the end of session 1.
- Note on history: commit `dbc5a5d` (step 4) does not build on its own — its service file imports `adapters/ai.ts` and
  `modules/pin.ts`, which arrived one commit later in `38a2c1c` (step 5). Every later commit builds.

## How to run the journeys on this PC
- Playwright's Chromium is installed (02/10/2026): plain `pnpm e2e` runs the journeys against `pnpm dev` (staff :3000,
  api :4000). The installed-Chrome route still works: `cd e2e` then `CHROME_PATH="C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" pnpm exec playwright test -c pw.local.config.ts`.
- Older dev servers were holding ports 3000/3001/3100 on 02/10/2026 (the one on 3100 had crashed). A journey server can
  now run beside them with its own build folder: `cd apps/staff` then `NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-e2e pnpm exec next dev -p 3200`,
  and `STAFF_URL=http://localhost:3200` for Playwright. Next rewrites `apps/staff/tsconfig.json` and `next-env.d.ts`
  for that folder when it starts: restore them (`git checkout -- apps/staff/tsconfig.json apps/staff/next-env.d.ts`)
  before committing. Stop old `next dev` processes before `pnpm dev`.
- API contract test files run one at a time (`apps/api/vitest.config.ts`): they share the E2E family.
- **Tests never touch the demo clinic.** The API contract tests and the Playwright journeys that create patients or visits sign in to the seeded **E2E Test Clinic** (`t_e2e`, users 01799000001 receptionist / …02 doctor / …09 owner / …10 admin, prefix `E2E-`, same walkthrough family). Playwright's `e2e/global-setup.ts` runs `pnpm db:reset-e2e` (restores the family, closes open reviews) and warms the dev server. The cross-tenant fixtures in the Hospital Lite demo are deleted after each API run. Green Life (`t_greenlife`) stays at its 8 seeded patients and an empty queue; the test patients made before 02/10/2026 evening were removed.
- Shell specs still sign in as Green Life users; they only read.

## Known gaps (fix in the slice that touches them, or when listed)
1. ~~RLS is bypassed at runtime~~ — fixed in A1–A3 (`setu_app`). Production: the migration role must be superuser or BYPASSRLS for `auth_login_lookup` (open question 11).
2. **MinIO image cannot be pulled** on this machine (Docker Hub / quay denied). Not needed until PDFs in A6–A7; then switch to another S3-compatible image or a local-folder storage adapter for dev.
3. Password and PIN hashing is dev-only SHA-256 (`apps/api/src/modules/users.ts`); replace with argon2id in the auth hardening pass (before the pilot).
4. PIN attempt counter and idempotency keys live in memory when the DB is off; with the DB they use `IdempotencyKey`; PIN tries should move to Redis.
5. Home-page figures are sample data; each slice swaps its tiles/rows for live queries.
6. Patient app (`apps/patient`) is a placeholder until Journey D.
7. Prisma migrations: create with `--create-only`, append SQL, then apply (see `packages/db/prisma/migrations/README.md`). Never edit an applied migration.

8. Front desk follow-ups (not blocking A4): queue reorder with reason (+ audit), Lab/Billing queue columns, register "Save draft" and the register-screen Compare for an unsaved form (today: "Visit on this record" per candidate), payer/photo/referral fields (need Coverage/Media), records-officer role for review Tasks, branch choice for multi-branch organisations.
9. Some screen strings still come from the shell's inline `L(bn, en)`; new screens use `packages/i18n` namespaces (`locales/app/*.json`).
10. **Pre-pilot security pass** (decided 02/10/2026, open questions 20 and 24):
    - composite `(tenantId, id)` foreign keys for Patient.linkedToId, Task.focusId/candidateId, Provenance.targetId and Encounter.patientId (defence in depth beside RLS);
    - `pnpm db:migrate` must stop sending the `setu_app` password in plain text (SCRAM hash, or statement logging off);
    - together with gap 3 (argon2id) and gap 4 (PIN tries in Redis).
12. **Pre-pilot clinical content (decisions D2, D3 of 02/10/2026):**
    - ICD-11: a clinician verifies the 10 seeded codes against the WHO ICD-11 browser; production source = WHO ICD-11
      API or a local extract.
    - Medicines: a licensed drug database with DGDA numbers + clinician-approved allergy/interaction rules; the demo
      list's class matching is a demo check only (`packages/domain/src/catalog.ts`, all rows `sample`).
    - Clinician questions from session 2 (open questions 53, 54, 56, 58): esomeprazole in the interaction rule, same
      medicine against earlier visits, allergy cross-reactivity, severity and blocking.
    - Lawyer: AI scribe consent wording before any recording is turned on (the tick stays disabled until then).
    - Vitals limits (decision 46): clinician sign-off of the default thresholds (prototype + adult NEWS2) in
      `packages/domain/src/vitals.ts`, a critical-high glucose, and paediatric/infant ranges (none yet; under 18 the
      screen says the ranges are for adults).
11. **Patients are per tenant** (decided 02/10/2026, open question 21): one record shared across an owner's branches; between different owners only through Connected Care with consent (Journey E), never by default.

## Next (in order)
1. ~~`/slice A1-A3`~~ — done 02/10/2026.
2. `/slice A4-A5` — sessions 1 (follow-ups + vitals) and 2 (consultation backend, plan steps 1–6) done 02/10/2026.
   **Session 3 next — plan steps 7–10:**
   - Run `pnpm e2e` first (not re-run in session 2).
   - Screens `cons/draft` (worklist → note: complaint, history, exam, vitals read-only, diagnosis search bn/en, orders,
     Rx builder with the warnings from `rxWarnings`, Record allergy + entered-in-error, AI panel "draft — not a
     diagnosis" with the scribe's "Patient agreed to recording" tick shown disabled "not available yet", sign sheet with
     PIN showing "Waiting for server — still a draft" until the API answers, "Sign when back online" offline),
     `cons/signed`, `cons/amended` (version history); "/" focuses the Rx search (#9), Ctrl+Enter sign, Alt+1…9, Esc.
     Register in `apps/staff/modules/registry.tsx`; strings in `packages/i18n/locales/app/consultApp.json`.
   - Offline drafts (Kamrul 02/10/2026): stored per user on the device, cleared at sign-out, kept at most 24 h; never
     sign offline.
   - `e2e/journeys/a5.spec.ts` (+ #9, #16 regressions, 1024 px) as the E2E doctor on Rahima Khatun; extend
     `db:reset-e2e` so her allergies and visits start clean.
   - Clinical-safety and security reviews, hands-on test as the doctor, HANDOVER, commit, push.
3. `/slice A6-A7` — billing, payments (FakeProvider), receipt PDF (+ gap 2).
4. `/slice A8-A11` — lab.
5. `/slice A12-A13` — doctor app layout, printing; run all of Journey A.
Prompt texts for each are in `docs/CLAUDE-CODE-GUIDE.md`.

## Conventions worth repeating
Every write route takes `Idempotency-Key`; every table has `tenantId`; money is paisa; strings through `@setu/i18n`; numbers through `@setu/domain` `format`; status changes only through `@setu/domain` state machines; a journey step is done when its Playwright spec is green on the real stack.
